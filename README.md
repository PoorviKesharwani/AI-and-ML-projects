Building an AI-Powered Expert System for Cardiovascular Disease Detection and Treatment Recommendation Using H2O AutoML and BERT

Introduction
With cardiovascular diseases (CVDs) being a leading cause of mortality worldwide, technology-driven solutions hold transformative potential for early detection and treatment. In this blog, I share my journey of creating an AI-based expert system that leverages H2O’s AutoML for prediction accuracy, advanced rule-based reasoning (forward and backward chaining) for diagnosis verification, and a BERT model for personalized treatment recommendations.

Project Overview
The project’s goal was to build a reliable AI system capable of early detection of cardiovascular conditions based on patient data, along with customized treatment guidance. This was achieved by combining:

Forward and Backward Chaining: For rule-based diagnostic accuracy.
H2O AutoML: For automated model selection and hyperparameter tuning.
BERT Model: For advanced treatment recommendation based on patient context.

Data and Tools Used
The dataset included various cardiovascular health indicators such as blood pressure, cholesterol levels, and more. Key tools and libraries used:

H2O AutoML for model selection and tuning.
Python for data preprocessing and model integration.
BERT Transformer for analyzing and generating treatment recommendations.

Key Features of the System
Forward Chaining for Diagnostic Inference Forward chaining allows the system to assess symptoms provided by users. It progressively narrows down potential cardiovascular conditions based on known medical rules, delivering preliminary insights on possible diagnoses.
Backward Chaining for Verification To improve accuracy, the system verifies forward chaining conclusions by performing backward checks. This cross-verification helps reduce false positives by ensuring that all possible data points align with the diagnosis.
H2O AutoML for Predictive Precision Using H2O AutoML, the model automatically selects and tunes the best-performing algorithms, optimizing for metrics like accuracy and AUC. The model then predicts the likelihood of a cardiovascular event, helping assess patient risk.
BERT for Tailored Treatment Recommendations Post-diagnosis, the system leverages a BERT model to suggest personalized treatments and preventive strategies. This BERT-based approach generates recommendations aligned with evidence-based guidelines, which are tailored to individual patient profiles.

Challenges and Solutions
Data Quality and Missing Values: Handling missing values and ensuring data accuracy were critical. Using H2O’s na_omit function allowed me to manage missing data without manual intervention.
Complexity of Backward Chaining in Python: Implementing backward chaining required careful rule-setting to avoid infinite loops. I addressed this by establishing clear stopping conditions and prioritizing the most critical symptoms.
Integrating BERT Recommendations Creating a seamless integration between the predictive model and BERT for treatment suggestions was challenging. I resolved this by designing a separate pipeline for BERT post-prediction to avoid interference with the main diagnostic model.

Outcome and Future Enhancements
The system successfully categorizes patient risk levels and provides evidence-based recommendations. Future directions include integrating more data sources, improving the BERT model with more specialized medical data, and adding multi-language support to reach broader audiences.

Conclusion
This project highlights the potential of combining rule-based reasoning with advanced ML techniques to support critical healthcare functions. Building AI solutions for healthcare is challenging but rewarding, and with continuous advancements, AI could become a crucial player in global healthcare.
